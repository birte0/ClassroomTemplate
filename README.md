# GitHub Classroom Template

Hello and welcome! You have just created your very own GitHub classroom repository. 

There is one important rule here: **commit + push = submit**!

If this does not make sense yet, don't worry and read on. :)

## Fundamentals of Git and GitHub

![git.png](res/git.png)

### Git (local repository)
> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. [(see Git, 2023)](https://git-scm.com/)

Some source-code editors come with build-in Git (and even GitHub) capabilities or can be extended (e.g. [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which I use during this course).

Your local repository is essentially a folder on your local file system. Changes made in that folder can be committed to the (local) git repository. 

First, "stage" your changes - this is sth. like a pre-commit:

```Bash
# The '*' adds all changes made in your local folder
git add *
```

In the broadest sense, you could see Git as a block chain of commits (changes) made to your repository. You can thus
* observe a complete (almost immutable) history.
* `git checkout` the state at any commit to the repository.

* Getting started (videos, tutorials): https://git-scm.com/doc

### GitHub (remote repository)

You can `clone` the course repository to your local system:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/iwh-halle/ML2024.git
```

Your local Git repository remembers its origins. This enables you to `pull` updates from the remote (Git does not synchronize automatically). 

```Bash
git pull
```

If you have write access to the remote, you can also `push` changes to it.

```Bash
git push
```

Careful: Git tries its best to merge the remote with the local repository, however, might fail if the two repositories are 'too' diverging. This should not concern you too much as a single user, but becomes very relevant when collaborating on a remote.

This is all we need for now, however, it is only the tip of the iceberg. More on GitHub:

## Submitting your solutions

Reading this you have likely received a GitHub Classroom link, which should have created this - your very own solutions repository - automatically. You should start by ``git clone`` this repository to your personal computer. You can then start working on your solutions. If you are happy with your changes, ``git commit`` and ``git push`` the changes back to the remote repository. All the changes pushed to the remote repository before the deadline will be counted towards your submission, hence: **commit + push = submit**!

Here is a quick reference for the most important commands: git_cheat_sheet.pdf

## Coding style

Without being too pedantic, we follow the [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). When in doubt, return to this source for guidance.

### Naming convention

Here are some best practices to follow when naming stuff.
* Use all lowercase. Ex: `name` instead of `Name`
* One exception: class names should start with a capital letter and follow by lowercase letters.
* Use snake_case convention (i.e., separate words by underscores, look like a snake). Ex: ``gross_profit`` instead of ``grossProfit`` or ``GrossProfit``.
* Should be meaningful and easy to remember. Ex: ``interest_rate`` instead of ``r`` or ``ir``.
* Should have a reasonable length. Ex: ``sales_apr`` instead of ``sales_data_for_april``
* Avoid names of popular functions and modules. Ex: avoid ``print``, ``math``, or ``collections``.

### Comments

Comments should help to understand how your code works and your intentions behind it! 

> Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes! Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!). [(PEP 8)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments)
